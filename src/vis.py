# comparative and illustrative visualisations

# 1) comparing performace with different additions against hsitorical data (add backtesting later)
# 2) showing all the simulated paths (and colour coding them for risk)
# 3) future projections for various stocks (maybe have them fade into red as the time steps get longer and longer to show possible inaccuracy)
